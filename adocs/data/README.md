# Measurement evidence

Raw output of runs that a decision or a completed step rests on. Kept because
regenerating any of it costs hours of reference search, and because a number in
`decisions.md` that cannot be re-derived is an assertion rather than a
measurement.

Append only in practice: a file here is the evidence for something already
recorded, so it is added, never edited.

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `S018_match.pgn` | the 210 games achesso vs sgambetto at 10+0.2 that S018 profiled, loose adjudication (DEC-031) |
| `S018_raw.tsv` | 13522 per-move records from `tools/error_profile.py` over that PGN, scored by Stockfish `dev-20260803-762dd1da` at 3000000 nodes (DEC-030). Re-bucket with `tools/error_profile.py --from-raw`, no engine needed |
| `DEC033_depth_vs_eval.tsv` | 160 positions from `S018_raw.tsv` re-asked of chesso at 4M and 64M nodes and re-costed, produced by `tools/depth_vs_eval.py`. The evidence for DEC-033 |

`S018_raw.tsv` columns: `game ply phase cost ref own mate san fen`. `cost` is
the reference's swing across the move and may be negative, which the profiler
floors at zero before reporting; the spread of those negatives is the noise
floor of the reference limit.
