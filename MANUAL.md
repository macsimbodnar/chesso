# Chesso — user manual

For running the engine. To build or change it, see `DEV_MANUAL.md`.

Chesso is a UCI engine. It has no graphical interface of its own: point a UCI
GUI at the binary, or type the protocol at it directly.

## Install

Build it (see `DEV_MANUAL.md`) and use `build/src/chesso`. There is no installer
and no packaged release.

In a GUI, add a new engine and give it the path to that binary. In a shell:

```
$ ./build/src/chesso
uci
id name Chesso
id author MazerFaker
option name Use Book type check default false
option name Hash type spin default 16 min 1 max 4096
option name Threads type spin default 1 min 1 max 1
uciok
```

## Options

| name | type | default | range | effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Use Book` | check | `false` | — | play from the built-in opening book when the position is in it. Only `true` and `false` are recognised; any other value leaves the setting unchanged |
| `Hash` | spin | 16 | 1 to 4096 | transposition table size in MB, clamped into range. Not honoured exactly — see known bugs. A non-numeric value is ignored with a warning in the log |
| `Threads` | spin | 1 | 1 to 1 | present so GUIs that insist on setting it do not fail. **The search is single-threaded**; any value other than `1` is ignored with a warning in the log |

Set them the usual way:

```
setoption name Hash value 256
setoption name Use Book value true
```

## Commands

Standard UCI: `uci`, `debug`, `isready`, `setoption`, `register`, `ucinewgame`,
`position`, `go`, `stop`, `ponderhit`, `quit`.

`go` understands `depth`, `movetime`, `nodes`, `wtime`, `btime`, `winc`, `binc`,
`movestogo` and `infinite`.

`go mate`, `go searchmoves` and `go ponder` are **accepted and ignored**, with a
warning in the log. UCI says to ignore what is not implemented, and the rest of
the line still carries the time control. A GUI asking for a mate search gets a
normal search.

`ponderhit` is accepted; pondering itself is not implemented.

### Non-standard commands

Convenience only, not part of UCI. A GUI never sends these.

| command | what |
|---|---|
| `pb` | print the board |
| `fen` | print the current position as FEN |
| `help` | list commands |
| `test` | run the built-in self-test |
| `clean-tt` | clear the transposition table |

## Known bugs and limitations

- **Single-threaded.** `Threads` exists but cannot be set above 1.
- **No pondering.** `go ponder` is ignored and `ponderhit` does nothing useful.
- **No mate search.** `go mate N` is ignored and becomes a normal search.
- **No aspiration windows, futility pruning, razoring or singular extensions.**
  These are planned, not present; see `adocs/plan.md`.
- **Endgame evaluation is measurably optimistic.** Verified against Stockfish at
  depth 18: in one king-and-pawn endgame chesso reported +1.5 to +1.9 for ten
  consecutive moves where Stockfish valued the position at +0.25. Fixing it is
  S019. Do not trust chesso's evaluation of a simplified endgame.
- **The piece-square tables are hand-written and untuned.** Tuning them is S028.
- **`Hash` is not honoured exactly.** The value is clamped to 1–4096 MB, then the
  *entry count* is rounded down to a power of two so probing can mask instead of
  divide, so the table is usually smaller than asked for. If the allocation
  fails the engine halves the count and retries, and if every size fails it runs
  **without a transposition table** rather than refusing to play. Nothing is
  reported back over UCI in any of these cases; the log records them.
